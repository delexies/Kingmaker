A patch of raspberry-like fruits known as fangberries grows in a valley between two low hills here. Much of the thorny thicket is draped in the white gossamer silk of spiderwebs. The best of the berries lie at the heart of the thicket, but harvesting must be done slowly to avoid being lacerated by the thousands of fangberry thorns.

On the 8th of [[Pharast]] agriculture was expanded here and Fangberries were cultivated and now crops of these special berries cause this land to be a [[resource tile]] and produce an extra food on subsequent [[kingdom turns]]
