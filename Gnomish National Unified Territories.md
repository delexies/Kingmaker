**History**:
Established in the year 4724 on the 8th day of [[Calistril]], Four 4 [[Gnomes]] were given a charter to help clean up the untamed, bandit ridden lands so called [[The Stolen Lands]]. More specifically the [[Greenbelt]].

Along they way they befriended others such as fellow [[Gnomes]] [[Oleg and Svetlana]] and the [[Sootscale Kobolds]], while subjecting cohorts such as [[Jean Valjean]] and the [[Mitflits]] into loyal "interns".

Adventure ranging from fighting off bandits, slaughtering animal species into extinction (See: [[Owlbear]]), and chasing waterfalls. The crew found the [[Stag Lord]], leader and source of the reign of banditry in the [[Greenbelt]], and defeated him; thus freeing the area from rampant banditry.

All of [[Brevoy]] was filled with excitement and because of their bravery the group was given a charter to build a new nation - ally of [[Brevoy]] and [[Restov]], claiming the [[Greenbelt]] as their own and building an empire - one 12 mile step at a time.

Founding Members:

**Government:**
Officially an Oligarchy ruled through private council, the country of [[Gnomish National Unified Territories]] portrays itself the to its citizens, and the rest of the world, as a Monarchy with King [[Duke Mortis]] as the sitting ruler.

Infamous for how they rule their citizens and how they deal with their enemies, "Assimilate or Annihilate". 

Economy was a major factor and a large focus on crafting, production, and commerce are at the forefront of the county's operations.

**Economy**
Currently focused on establishing agriculture, lumber mills, and mines to allow for production of exportable goods.
**Loyalty**
The second driving force behind the success of [[GNUT]]. The citizens and members of society are kept to a high standard of loyalty and have severe consequences for those who are not.
**Stability**
While every nation strives for stability, [[GNUT]], philosophies state that with a strong economy and great loyalty - stability is sure to follow.
**Culture**
It is well known that [[Skysniffer]]'s are not typically seen in a good light, as the country grows they are more tolerant of the entry of these minorities.  The early culture is one of exclusion based on height - as it has been shown that [[Skysniffer]]'s are more violent and often repeat criminal offenders.
