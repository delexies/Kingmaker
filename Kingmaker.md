Four [[Gnomes]] [[Oratio Dolustella]] , [[Kaslen Wabblepabble]], [[Duke Mortis]], and [[Prophet Fortune]] received charge from [[Restov]] to enter the [[Stolen Lands]] to map and remove all signs of banditry from the [[Rostland Hinterlands]] and [[Greenbelt]] area.

Setting out in the winter on the 1st of [[Abadius]] in the year 4724 the Gnomes setout to meet their destiny.

Their first stop along the way was [[Oleg's Outpost]], a trading post established by a married pair of [[Gnomes]] - [[Oleg and Svetlana]].

In a just over a month of exploration the group was able to eliminate the threats caused by the [[Stag Lord]] and given a new [[Charter]] from Restov to settle and establish a kingdom in the [[Greenbelt]].  [[Calistril]] 8th became founding day for the adventurers as they created an Oligarchy but is portraying a Monarchy and appointed [[Duke Mortis]] as the King and settled on [[G.N.U.T]] or [[Gnomish National Unified Territories]]. 

Their first city, [[Good Question]], is also the current capitol of [[Gnomish National Unified Territories]] . 
Infamous for their [[Economy]] & [[Loyalty]] all backed by an "Assimilate or Annihilate" mentality.  Those who do not assimilate to the requests of the King (or Council) will be killed.  Offers to conquered people(s) are usually slavery or repurposing them, often colloquially referred to as "[[interns]]", to manual or high-risk labors, with the exception of their first [[Conquered Loyalist]] - [[Jean Valjean]].

The [[blacksmith's apprentice]] stopped by [[Oleg's Outpost]] and provided his services. 

Pharast 13-16th

[[Kavrit Koulik]] a journalist for the newly established news source - [[TMZ]], [[Tiny’s MegaZine.]]

He drilled [[Duke Mortis]] in a surprise interview about recent savage deaths. [[Duke Mortis]] was able to navigate the interview even when it turned a little passive aggressive. 

It was uncovered that a [[Werewolf]] in their midst.  [[ Kundall]], a recent visitor to [[Good Question]], who was beginning to setup a small trapping and trading business.
[[Duke Mortis]] and [[Kaslen Wabblepabble]] contracted the [[Curse of the Werewolf]] and will turn full [[Werewolf]] in 30 days after Pharast 15th. 

However, prior to this knowledge the [[Founders]] went to the woods to wait out the full moon in case their friends turn into [[Werewolf]] that night.
While they did not turn in the night, they were attacked by a [[Worg]] and [[Prophet Fortune]] was killed in the process.

They were allowed a small reprieve when a troop of loyalist vigilantes lead by [[Randy Stableton]]. The [[Range Riders of whatever the fuck I named them]] , took watch for the night allowing everyone to mourn and sleep.

In the morning when they were about to head back to [[Good Question]] they were approached by a [[Necromancer]] by the name of [[Eugene Eulogy]] 

He joined the ranks of the citizens of [[Good Question]] and he is currently a traveling companion.

Recently while exploring they found [[The Lonely Barrow]] while exploring the [[Kamelands]] in [[Tuskwater]]
