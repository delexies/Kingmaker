The isolated barrow mound of a barbarian warrior king stood in this section of the [[Kamelands]] for thousands of years. Over time, the earth near the mound subsided, opening a crack in the side of the tomb and disturbing the warlordâ€™s undead guardians, who were sworn to defend their lord and his sepulcher, even beyond death. The warlord, now known as the [[Lonely Warrior]], has risen as an undead blasphemy himself. Still bound inside his crypt, he rages against the walls of his prison, dreaming dark dreams of conquest and blood. Yet for all their wrath and hatred, these undead have relatively little impact on the surrounding terrain. This, along with the fact that the tomb is not easily distinguishable from the other hills dotting the landscape, means that the barrow has gone undiscovered for many centuries.

The [[Lonely Barrow]] is located at area [[TW5]] in [[Tuskwater]]. Its interior is unlit, and its ceilings average 7 feet high in halls, but rise to 9 feet high in chambers.
